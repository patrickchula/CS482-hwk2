  "body": "# CANNY\r\nFor the Canny I chose to use the thresholds 100,450 because I believed that it gave me a good indicator of strong lines. I checked with different types and when I used thresholds like 800,1000 there were very little lines. When I used 40,100, I was getting a lot of lines. So when it had the smaller thresholds it was noticing everything. \r\nSo I chose to have 100,200 because I only wanted to show the really strong edges. I did my testing with an image of the plants and window; my threshold was about to see the edge of the window, the plant against the sky and the door on the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n# STANDARD HOUGH\r\nI used the site we were directed from, opencv.org in order to learn about this. I chose to use the same threshold for my Canny. Some of the images did not provide any lines from the Canny edge detection. I checked very many different combinations of the edges to get the best lines. There were instances that I saw lines (for example on the ceilings) but the computer vision was not able to see them. Then were instances when it was picking up some very light lines. I didnâ€™t want to have the Canny with a lot of lines because it made the Hough Standard image covered in lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n# PROBALISTIC HOUGH \r\nThe biggest difference that I saw was that there more lines. But they were also a lot smaller. So it was getting more lines, because it was looking for smaller lines. Or maybe it was because the standard uses more of the angles with the RHO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### THESE ARE MY IMAGES! Some of them also have description of why I chose them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4024\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4042\t\r\nThese two because there were so similar, yet 43 has so many lines (Also to note that 4041 had more lines than 4042. Even though the pictures were so similar.) Still the vision is not perfect. It reminds of what professor Duric was talking about earlier on, that humans make take longer but we are smarter at vision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4043\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4057 \r\nBECAUSE IT DOES NOT SHOW ANY LINES FOR STANDARD...even though there are clearly so many lines. This is of course influenced by my choice of threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4087 \r\nI chose this one because it picked up so many lines, that I could not even see. \r\n\r\n",
