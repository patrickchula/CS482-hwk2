<a id="canny" class="anchor" href="#canny" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CANNY</h2>

<pre><code>For the Canny I chose to use the thresholds 100,450 because I believed that it gave me a good indicator of strong lines. I checked with different types and when I used thresholds like 800,1000 there were very little lines. When I used 40,100, I was getting a lot of lines. So when it had the smaller thresholds it was noticing everything. So I chose to have 100,450 because I only wanted to show the really strong edges. I did my testing with an image of the plants and window; my threshold was about to see the edge of the window, the plant against the sky and the door on the right.
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="standard-hough" class="anchor" href="#standard-hough" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>STANDARD HOUGH</h2>

<pre><code>I used the site we were directed from, opencv.org in order to learn about this. I chose to use the same threshold for my Canny. Some of the images did not provide any lines from the Canny edge detection. I checked very many different combinations of the edges to get the best lines. There were instances that I saw lines (for example on the ceilings) but the computer vision was not able to see them. Then were instances when it was picking up some very light lines. I didnâ€™t want to have the Canny with a lot of lines because it made the Hough Standard image covered in lines.

<h2>
<a id="probalistic-hough" class="anchor" href="#probalistic-hough" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PROBALISTIC HOUGH</h2>

<pre><code>    The biggest difference that I saw was that there more lines. But they were also a lot smaller. So it was getting more lines, because it was looking for smaller lines. Or maybe it was because the standard uses more of the angles with the RHO.
