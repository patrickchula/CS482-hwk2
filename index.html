<a id="canny" class="anchor" href="#canny" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CANNY</h1>

<p>For the Canny I chose to use the thresholds 100,450 because I believed that it gave me a good indicator of strong lines. I checked with different types and when I used thresholds like 800,1000 there were very little lines. When I used 40,100, I was getting a lot of lines. So when it had the smaller thresholds it was noticing everything. 
So I chose to have 100,150 because I only wanted to show the really strong edges. I did my testing with an image of the plants and window; my threshold was about to see the edge of the window, the plant against the sky and the door on the right. (I put some small observations above certain pictures). But the final choice of threshold I used was 100,150 because I believe it gave the best result.</p>

<h1>
<a id="standard-hough" class="anchor" href="#standard-hough" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>STANDARD HOUGH</h1>

<p>I used the site we were directed from, opencv.org in order to learn about this. I chose to use the same threshold for my Canny. Some of the images did not provide any lines from the Canny edge detection. When the thresholds were. There were even some instances in which the image was giving no lines for the same threshold; as images which were similar yet had many. I checked very many different combinations of the edges to get the best lines. There were instances that I saw lines (for example on the ceilings) but the computer vision was not able to see them. Then were instances when it was picking up some very light lines. I didnâ€™t want to have the Canny with a lot of lines because it made the Hough Standard image covered in lines. I did begin to notice, that even though some small lines were being picked up that I didn't see; it made sense why edges with huge contrast (white and black) showed with a lot of lines.</p>

<h1>
<a id="probalistic-hough" class="anchor" href="#probalistic-hough" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PROBALISTIC HOUGH</h1>

<p>The biggest difference that I saw was that there more lines. But they were also a lot smaller. So it was getting more lines, because it was looking for smaller lines. Or maybe it was because the standard uses more of the angles on the polar coordiantes. The probalistic Hough is only finding the lines which line on the either the X or the Y axis. Those are the differences. So each one has a strength.</p>

<p>These two because there were so similar, yet 43 has so many lines (Also to note that 4041 had more lines than 4042. Even though the pictures were so similar.) Still the vision is not perfect. It reminds of what professor Duric was talking about earlier on, that humans make take longer but we are smarter at vision.</p>

<p>I chose this one because it picked up so many lines, that I could not even see. But then I looked closely, and I saw something. On the right side, it was showing a lot of lines because of white letters on a black canvas (top right). However, on the left there are clear edges. But the edges are made by shadows. So it was harder for the Canny to find them. </p>
